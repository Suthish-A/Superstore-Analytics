### Worksheet Titles and KPIs:

Clearly defined worksheet titles and key performance indicators (KPIs) to communicate the dimensions and measures effectively.

### Tooltips:
Utilized tooltips throughout the dashboard to provide additional information and context to users.

### Filter Interactivity:
Implemented a show/hide filters feature for user convenience. Users can reveal or conceal filters by clicking on the respective icons.

### Filter Actions:
Configured filter actions to connect specific worksheets (bar chart, donut chart, and Top 5 bar chart) as source sheets with all other worksheets as target sheets. This ensures that filtering in one chart
reflects across the entire dashboard.

### Top 5 Products:
Calculated and displayed the top 5 products based on the sum of sales, regardless of the selected filter values or dropdown filter selections.

### Dashboard Navigation:
Integrated a navigation system with tabs for different views. Clicking on the "Detail Report" tab opens Dashboard 2, while clicking on the "Sales Analytics" tab opens Dashboard 1.
### Tools Used

### Tableau Desktop:
 Primary tool for creating visualizations, dashboards, and interactivity.

### Microsoft Excel:
Possibly used for data preparation, cleaning, or additional analysis before importing data into Tableau

### Dashboard over view
